# Performance report

## Summary
- Large dataset successfully seeded and validated with no integrity or runtime issues.
- Static analysis: Pylint score 10.00/10 (no errors or warnings).

## Dataset Scale and Coverage
- The website is able to handle a large dataset with no issues.
- The website uses paginated results for the /recipes endpoint, and the /recipes/<id> endpoint is able to handle large amounts of comments and ratings.
- A sample dataset is provided in the repo: `mock-data.sql`


## Functional Validation
- Authentication and CSRF: Verified flows for create, edit, comment, rate; enforcement remains intact.
- Recipe creation/edit:
  - Validations applied consistently (min/max lengths, category existence).
  - Category selection validated; invalid IDs handled gracefully.
- Image uploads: Size and format checks function; unknown formats rejected with clear error.
- Search and filtering (/recipes):
  - Combined text search (name, ingredients, directions) and category filter operate correctly.
  - Empty and non-digit category parameters safely ignored.
- Recipe details (/recipes/<id>):
  - Average rating and rating count correct with multiple ratings.
  - User’s own rating displayed when present.
  - Comments ordered newest-first; deletion restricted to comment author.
- Home (/) Top Recipes:
  - Correct ordering by avg rating desc, count desc, then id desc.
  - Empty-rating recipes show “—”.

## UX and Accessibility
- Text previews on / and /recipes:
  - Multi-line clamping with ellipses prevents overflow and layout breakage.
  - Titles, ingredients, and directions excerpts remain readable within card widths.
- Keyboard and screen-reader basics:
  - Landmarks (main/section), headings, and ARIA labels present and coherent.
  - Rating badges expose average/count via descriptive labels.

## Data Integrity and Quality
- All foreign keys valid (users, categories, recipes, comments, ratings).
- Non-null constraints respected.
- Categories are unique; recipes always assigned a valid category.
- Re-seeding is idempotent for categories; other tables fully reset during mock seed to ensure consistency.

## Linting and Code Quality
- Pylint score: 10.00/10.
- No remaining messages (errors/warnings/refactors).
- Validations and helpers maintain clear responsibilities and testable boundaries.

## Recommendations (Future-proofing)
- Replace everything with a Supabase + Next.js (React) + Tailwind stack.

## Conclusion
The application operates correctly and efficiently with a large dataset. Previews on / and /recipes truncate cleanly with ellipses, and the codebase passes Pylint at 10/10 quality with no issues.
