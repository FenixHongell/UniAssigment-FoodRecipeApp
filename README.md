# Uni Project?
Yes, Uni project

## Why Uni?
Why not?

### Is this assigment stupid?
Probably? I mean who uses a flask and html web-app today? <br/>They created react for a reason (or vue if that is your jam, no judgement here). <br/>Like I could make this in about 20min with nextjs and tailwind, and it would even look good. <br>**BUT NO!** we have to use monstrosity, we arent even allowed to use JS?!?!??<br/>Like POST and GET requests exist for a pretty solid reason.

### Am I salty?
Yep, not going to deny it.

### Can I use this?
I don't know why you would want to, but you can. Just don't come crying to me when you find an issue.
